# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is part of an AI & ML internship task focused on performing EDA using the Titanic dataset.

## Objective
To understand the dataset using descriptive statistics and visualizations to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset
- [Titanic Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)
- Alternatively used: [GitHub-hosted CSV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv)

## EDA Performed
- Summary statistics: `mean`, `median`, `std`, etc.
- Histograms and boxplots for numeric features (`Age`, `Fare`, `SibSp`, `Parch`)
- Heatmap and pairplot for feature correlation
- Countplots for categorical variables
- Handled missing values
- Inferred skewness and multicollinearity insights

## Key Insights
- Higher survival rates in 1st class and female passengers
- Positive correlation between fare and survival
- Noticeable skew in the `Fare` distribution
- Multicollinearity between some family-related features

## Repository Structure


## Submission
This task was submitted as part of the internship requirement.
